# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
**What did you do particularly well?**
I think I tried to think outside the box here as mutch as possible and try to combine all of my knowledge that I had learned and utlized all quarter into the final subimssion
**Where could you improve?**
I didn't get my board to connect to wifi for some reason it would never connect so that would have allowed me to actually complete the project
**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
I would add my abliity to understand micro controllers and boards and how they work and interface between the user and their software. I'm currently working at a data center so this class has added on to that skill set allowing me to have a better understanding of how everything software and hardware interface allowing me to be a better coder
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
See question above, but my ability to have a better understanding of the complete picture and piece together all things software and hardware.
**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
By commenting things as clearly as possible
